# Dog breed classification
Dog Breed classifier project of the Data Scientist Nanodegree by Udacity

# Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the AI Nanodegree! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a  app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.The Deep Learning model distinguishes between the 133 classes of dogs with an accuracy of over 84.09%.

For example:

# Steps Involved:
I. Import Datasets

II. Detect Humans

III. Detect Dogs

IV. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)

V. Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

VI. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)

VII. Writing the Pipeline

VIII Testing the Pipeline

IX Creating a Flask application for the same in which a user can upload an image and see the results.

# File Descriptions
The repository consists of the Jupyter Notebook files from the Udacity classroom, in both formats: dog_app.html and dog_app.ipynb.and test_images file contain 9 images to test the Algorithm

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@eebtehal.101/dog-breed-classification-cdcfb63515d9) .
